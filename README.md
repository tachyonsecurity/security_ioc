**Security_IOC**

It is a repository that maintains indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to various types of malicious activities, including malicious domains, IPs, and hashes. These IOCs could encompass a range of threats such as malware, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), browser hijackers, and phishing sites.
Having separate text files for each category of IOCs (malicious domains, IPs, and hashes) can help organize the data and make it more manageable for security analysts to analyze and use for threat detection and response.
Analyzing and monitoring these IOCs can help detect and respond to security incidents more effectively, thereby protecting against potential data breaches or other malicious activities.
Create an issue if there are any suggestions or incorrect mapping of the IOCs by accessing the Issues section of this respository.
